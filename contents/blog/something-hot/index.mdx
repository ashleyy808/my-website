## Why I Left my Medical Career for the Tech World 

---
#### What am I doing here? 
I should probably start off by telling you that tech is not a foreign concept to me. I was always on the computer as long as I can remember. Back then, it was merely a hobby that has now translated into a new career path. I was ready for the challenge that was in front of me. With hard work, persistence, and discipline, I knew I would be able to craft to my new skills and begin my new journey. 

#### Diving in deeper
Being surrounded by the medical community gave me a glimpse into my potential future where I would be helping others. Something that I am extremely passionate about. It was only until recently where I caught a peek of how I can instill change in a whole new way. A way where I can connect with people and find solutions that will improve their lives by making it more efficient. 

#### Medicine VS. Technology
IT is fast, constantly evolving, and is such an important part in the lives of everyone. I thought “this is amazing. I want to be apart of that environment”. Being involved in ground breaking tech ideas and finding ways to implement technology into innovative ideas has always fascinated me. Now how does the tech and business field overpower my love for medicine? Didn’t I say that I want to change the world? Well, I would be lying if I said I was not still passionate about medicine and science. Being on the cutting edge of medicine and finding new ways to treat patients is just as rewarding. I’ll miss it, but it does not mean I will not be able to help improve the efficiency of people’s lives. If anything, the medical field has prepared me to pay attention to critical details while not losing site of the big picture. It has also enabled me to improve my analytical abilities without losing creativity. 

#### Wrapping up my thoughts
After a lot of thought and endless mind loops, I’m sure about the direction I’m taking. I welcome a good puzzle, and tech is a fulfilling, fast-moving, and egalitarian way of achieving my goals. And who knows what the future has in store for me. Maybe one day in the not so distant future–I keep telling myself–I’ll find a way to combine both medicine and technology into something even more meaningful.
